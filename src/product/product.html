    <h2>Why Should I Buy This?</h2>
    <p>You might be asking yourself: how is this any better than a phone with a waterproof screen?

      Secondly, this all-new invention will revalutionize the way we experience the underwater world. 
      If you're not a fan of the water, then this isn't for you and that's fine!
